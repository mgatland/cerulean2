to do:

[ ] spawn build areas in some rooms
[ ] let the player build stuff on 'build areas' (empty green boxes)
[ ] late game, let the player create their own build areas anywhere
	stuff like: teleporters, temporary powerups, currency gatherers
[ ] some enemies move between rooms, chasing the player from up to 5 rooms away.
[ ] rooms with only one door are special (boss rooms? treasure rooms?)
[ ] some rooms are randomly just treasure rooms
[ ] The world has 9 regions. Each has different enemies and room sizes.
[ ] much more enemy diversity

Presentation:
[ ] add synth sounds
[ ] switch to WebGL graphics
[ ] add a fancy glow\blur effect

Story?

Add the companion?
Who:
	avoids shots as well as she can
	stays close to the player
	follows if she's in another room
	attacks nearby projectiles with her projectile-destroyer
	or maybe she can freeze enemies, or shots, while they're under her cursor.

[X] clean shots in a room when the player leaves that room
	I don't like the feel of this (arbitrarily resetting world state), but it prevents players getting a room into an unwinnable state. And it's the easiest solution.
